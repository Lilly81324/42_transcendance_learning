typeof-operator (NOT A FUNCTION)
	returns a string of the type
	used like: let type = typeof var
	Also works for functions (like alert)

Conversion:
	To string:
		Usually done automatically, can be done with result = String(value)
	To number:
		Done automatically with operations, or explicitely with result = Number(value)
		undefined -> NaN
		null -> 0
		true, false -> 1, 0
		strings -> Ignores whitespace at start and end, tries to read, if it cant, then NaN
	To bool:
		Can be done with result = Boolean(value)
		0, null, undefined, NaN, "" -> false
		rest -> true

Operations:
	4 basic ones, % modulo, and ** exponentiation
	+ on strings concatenates
	other operations on strings treat them like numbers

Order of Operations:
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Operator_precedence)
Higher number = higher precedence
8 new
7 ++ / --
6 math operations
5 bitshifting
4 logical Operators
3 bitwise operations
2 asignement
1 ,

Modify in place
	n = n+2 can be written as n+= 2
	This goes for all arithmetic and bitwise Operators

Increment / Decrement
	var++, ++var, var--, --var work
	post incrementing (var++) returns the previous value
	1 = 1++
	2 = ++1
