CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) practices describe the actions databases may perform.

For MySql the commands are:
Create	= INSERT
Read 	= SELECT
Update	= UPDATE
Delete	= DELETE

For Https the methods are:
Create	= POST
Read 	= GET
Update	= PUT/PATCH
Delete	= DELETE

They are the basic building blocks for any service that interacts with databases or information.
Combined with ACID Operations and Orm they pave the way between Front-End Requests,
and Back-End Interaction with databases or programs.
