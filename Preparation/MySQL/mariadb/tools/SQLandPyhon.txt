Include Library with
import mysql.connector
at the top of your file.
(Note that the package has to be installed already)

Installing the package can be done in a virtual enviroment:
1)
mkdir project
cd project
python -m venv env
2)
Use the virtuial python version by running:
source env/bin/activate
3)
Then installing the package:
pip install mysql-connector-python
4)
In the same Terminal, execute your program:
python ./your_script_here

Or by forcefully installing the mysql-connector package:
pip3 install mysql-connector --break-system-packages
(Potentially dangerous)

Then connect to the database by creatign a Connection as such:
connection_name = mysql.connector.connect(
  host="localhost",
  database=' ',
  user=" ",
  password=" "
)
You may then reference your Connection via connection_name

Then, for creating Transactions, make a Cursor like this:
cursor_name = connection_name.cursor()
You may then reference your Connection via cursor_name

Then you can send Requests like this:
cursor_name.execute("SELECT * from transDB.users;")
Where the text in brackets AND quotes is your Request.
!NOTE!
If your Request changes data, you should commit it ASAP.

Commiting a Transaction:
connection_name.commit()
Performs all your queued Transaction on the Database.
You may queue multiple Transactions in a row, and commit them all at once.
Just dont forget about comitting.

Un-comitting a Transaction:
connection_name.rollback()
